/// Translation layer for the mod's OWN announcements (2026-09-05).
///
/// The mod speaks English prompts from ~hundreds of call sites ("Dialogue reader on.",
/// "Took 42 damage.", …). Instead of touching every one of them, EVERY spoken line is
/// funnelled through <c>Speech.SayCore</c>, which asks this class for a replacement
/// right before <c>Tolk.Output</c>. Miss = the original English is spoken, so a partial or
/// missing table degrades gracefully rather than muting anything.
///
/// DATA FILE — <c>ui_strings.tsv</c>, flat in the mod folder (resolved through
/// <see cref="Utils.DataPath"/>, so the dev tree's database/ folder works too). TAB separated,
/// UTF-8, first line is the header. Columns are found BY HEADER NAME, so their order is free and
/// any column this class does not know about is silently ignored — the extraction pipeline may
/// add bookkeeping columns without touching the loader. What it produces today:
///
///     key  file  line  en  zh-TW  zh-CN  raw
///
///   • key / file / line / raw — bookkeeping for the extraction pipeline (<c>raw</c> keeps the
///             original C# interpolated string the row was lifted from, for review); ignored here.
///   • en    — the EXACT English string as passed to Speech.Say, optionally with {0} {1} …
///             placeholders standing in for the runtime-interpolated parts. Loaded through the
///             same U+3000 → ASCII space clean-up Speech.SayCore applies before asking us, so a
///             cell pasted from the game's full-width text still matches.
///   • zh-TW / zh-CN — the translation, reusing the same {n} placeholders (they may be
///             re-ordered; {2} may come before {0}). An EMPTY cell means "not translated
///             yet" and the row is skipped for that language.
///
/// Example rows (→ = a TAB, trailing bookkeeping columns elided):
///
///     key                → file       → line → en                        → zh-TW      → zh-CN
///     speech.no_history  → Speech.cs  → 125  → No history.               → 沒有歷史紀錄。 → 没有历史记录。
///     battle.damage      → Battle.cs  → 88   → {0} took {1} damage.      → {0} 受到 {1} 點傷害。 → {0} 受到 {1} 点伤害。
///
/// <c>ui_strings.sample.tsv</c> next to the sources is documentation only — it is NEVER loaded.
/// The one file that takes effect is <c>ui_strings.tsv</c>.
///
/// Escapes: <c>\n</c>, <c>\r</c>, <c>\t</c> and <c>\\</c> are decoded in the en/translation
/// cells (a TSV cell cannot hold a real tab or line break).
///
/// LANGUAGE — driven by <see cref="Native.Text.GameLanguage.ActiveTable"/>, the table already
/// chosen for the game's text: P4G_CHT.tsv → zh-TW column, P4G_CHS.tsv → zh-CN column,
/// anything else → the layer stays DISABLED and <see cref="TryTranslate"/> is a single bool
/// test (zero cost for English/Japanese/Korean players).
///
/// MATCHING — exact lookup first (a plain <see cref="Dictionary{TKey,TValue}"/> on the ordinal
/// string), then the placeholder rows in file order, each pre-compiled ONCE at startup into an
/// anchored regex where every {n} became a capture group (<c>(.+?)</c>, or <c>(.+)</c> for a
/// group at the very end of the template). The captured runtime values are then dropped into
/// the {n} slots of the target-language template. First match wins.
///
/// EXACT-ONLY MODE — a handful of components do not author prompts at all, they forward the GAME's
/// own text (Dialogue, SubtitleReader, SystemMessage, MessageBubble, TelopReader, BacklogReader,
/// InternetDialog, Tutorial, GameOverReader, SocialLinkDetail — the list lives in
/// <c>Speech.ForwardedGameTextSources</c>). Speech.SayCore passes <c>exactOnly: true</c> for those,
/// so the pattern rows are skipped and only the exact table applies. Without it a loose row could
/// match a whole English game sentence and replace just the word it recognised, which is exactly
/// how "…when you're in a pinch,和you to help others in turn" reached a player (2026-09-05).
/// Their own fixed prompts are unaffected — an exact row still translates them.
///
/// Each captured value is itself looked up ONCE in the exact table on the way in (never in the
/// patterns — that would recurse), because some captures are English words the C# side generated:
/// month names, weekdays, directions. A single-word row like <c>date.month.april → 四月</c> in the
/// data file therefore fixes "預報，April15日" everywhere at once. No hit = kept verbatim.
///
/// PLACEHOLDER ROW LIMITS — a row whose <c>en</c> breaks either rule is dropped at load time
/// (logged, and that prompt simply stays English):
///
///   • The literal text left after removing every {n} must contain at least one letter or digit.
///     "{0} {1}" or "{0}: {1}" would otherwise compile into a regex matching nearly any sentence
///     — including the game's own dialogue, which is spoken through the same Speech.Say path.
///   • That literal text must not be a lone "and" / "or" sitting BETWEEN placeholders, i.e. with
///     no letter or digit at either end of the template. "{0} and {1}" passes the rule above yet
///     still matches any sentence containing that word, and can only ever fix one prompt.
///     Deliberately narrow: an edge anchor ("{0} HP", "Row {0}", "{0} on.") or a word that carries
///     meaning ("{0} of {1}.", "{0}, now {1}") keeps the row — those only see sentences the mod
///     assembled itself, and the exact-only mode above already shields the game's own text.
///   • The same {n} may appear only ONCE in <c>en</c>. "{0} beats {0}" would need a regex
///     back-reference; two independent groups would match too much and the second capture would
///     be discarded. Give the two parts distinct numbers ("{0} beats {1}") instead. The
///     TRANSLATION side has no such limit — it may repeat or omit any {n}.
///
/// SAFETY — a missing / malformed file, a missing column, a bad row or a runaway regex can
/// only disable this layer (or skip that row): nothing here is allowed to throw into the
/// speech path. Everything is logged through <see cref="Utils.Log"/> with the [i18n] tag.
